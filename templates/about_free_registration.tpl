<h3>Problems with Closed Family Trees</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most relatives won't pay fees, which means your family history doesn't get "shared" very much.</li>
<li>Search engines can't access them, which means many researchers will never find your ancestors.</li>
<li>Subscription sites will never gain critical mass. Imagine Wikipedia charging $15/month.</li>
<li>Users aren't willing to donate time and energy to content that is ultimately by a big corporation.</li>
</ol>
