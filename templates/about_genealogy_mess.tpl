<h3>Repetitive merging cause errors</h3>
<ol>
<li>Bob and Susan start with the same file containing 5000 names</li>
<li>Bob makes a change (adds a person, corrects a date, moves a child)</li>
<li>Susan wants an update from Bob, receives a GEDCOM, and attempts to merge the 5000 duplicates now created by the import.</li>
<li>Susan makes uneducated decisions, leaves duplicates, gets lazy, and finishes with a new file worse than the one she started with.</li>
<li>Susan publishes the new file to a website from which 100 relatives download the error laden file and start the process over again.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Working in isolation results in duplicate work</h3>
<ol>
<li>Bob travels to Boston to research his great-grandfather.</li>
<li>Susan travels two months later to Boston to research her great-grandfather (same person).</li>
<li>Bob and Susan find the same information for twice the cost and publish to website.</li>
<li>Six months later Mike posts over Bob’s and Susan’s research with older incorrect information.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Read-only submissions propagate errors</h3>
<ol>
<li>Bob joins 19 other relatives in posting information about his great-grandfather.</li>
<li>The other 19 records stay stagnant and incorrect.</li>
<li>Bob's correct submission is buried under 19 others.</li>
<li>Bob has no way of updating the invalid posts.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Duplicate records discourage discussion</h3>
<ol>
<li>Bob would be happy to post proof documentation for correction but doesn’t bother since 19 records exist and no central location exists for this ancestor.</li>
<li>Bob finds rare photo of ancestor but doesn’t bother sharing the photo because there is no central record.</li>
</ol>
